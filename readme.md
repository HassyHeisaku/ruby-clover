# CLoveR is a static site generator
CLoveR (ChangeLog over Ruby) will generate static blog from Changelog file.

## How to start
Copy "sample" directory contents on same directory of "clover.rb".
Run "ruby clover.rb".

## Before start, need to put free font file.
Unfortunately one of the plugin requires "ttc" font file.
So please put "freefont.ttc" on "plugin/lib/"

## Required lib
Gemfile shows required lib. 
mini_magick require ImageMagick. So please install ImageMagick.

## Sample site
my blog uses CLoveR.
